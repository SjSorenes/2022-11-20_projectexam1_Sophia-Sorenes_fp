# Good Food Mood

This is a website for an imagined business called Good Food Mood which helps people to find
recipes.

## Description

Using an API, the aim of this project was to make a fun and engaging website that guided users to take action. 
The target audience was working people who are interested in eating healthy and interesting food, 
but don't have a lot of time to read recipe books. The API should be used to allow users to input ingredients and get back a list of recipes.

The website should be responsive and be easy to use on a variety of devices.

Creating this website required me to consider design principles, project management, communication technology, and developing with HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

Some points I especially focused on:

- Employing JavaScript/JSON API for dynamic data and construction and styling of
HTML/CSS.
- JavaScript validation of the contact form.
- Conforming to WCAG standards and making a well-designed page.
